## What Is Streamr?

Streamr is an open source, crowdfunded, decentralized platform for realtime data. At its heart is the <Link to={links.site.network}>Streamr Network</Link>, which transports <Link to={links.newdocs.streams}>streams</Link> of messages from data publishers to subscribers, appearing to the user as a global publish/subscribe messaging service.

It is similar in functionality to message queues, enterprise messaging systems, MQTT brokers, Apache Kafka, or pub/sub messaging services in the cloud. The key features of such systems, including Streamr, are:

- Publishing messages in order to make them available to subscribers
- Subscribing to messages in order to process them as they occur
- Storing messages for later use

The big difference to comparable systems is that Streamr is *decentralized and peer-to-peer*. There are various advantages to decentralization:

- You don't need to set up any servers to use it
- You don't need to trust any 3rd party with your data
- You benefit from the network effects of everyone participating in the same network, instead of having to operate in an isolated silo

Instead of a centralized party, the Network is run by its community of users, and it heavily relies on cryptography to remove the need for trust. This creates a permissionless and neutral network for realtime data, which is highly suitable for use cases such as data sharing, data monetisation, and the <Link to={links.external.decentralizedWeb}>decentralised web</Link>, extending the capabilities of the underlying internet without compromising its open and decentralised nature.

Another major difference is that Streamr utilizes a companion blockchain, currently <Link to={links.external.ethereum}>Ethereum</Link>. The blockchain provides users with secure digital identities and enables direct transfers of value in the form of a Streamr-specific cryptocurrency <Link to={links.newdocs.dataToken}>DATA</Link>.

You can interact with Streamr using the <Link to={links.newdocs.core}>Core</Link> user interface, <Link to={links.newdocs.api}>SDKs</Link>, or directly via the <Link to={links.newdocs.api}>API</Link>.

In addition to the Network, the Streamr stack includes the <Link to={links.newdocs.core}>Core webapp</Link> for easily managing your Streamr resources, a <Link to={links.newdocs.marketplace}>Marketplace</Link> for data sharing and monetization, and <Link to={links.newdocs.canvases}>Canvases</Link> for data processing and analytics.

## Key Concepts

- <Link to={links.newdocs.streams}>Streams</Link> are the primary resource on the Streamr Network. They contain ordered sequences of timestamped messages. Message payloads are arbitrary JSON objects. Streams are topics used to group messages which logically belong together. For example, a particular connected device might publish its measurements to a particular stream. Streams have names, descriptions, and other metadata to help describe and discover the content.

- <Link to={links.newdocs.canvases}>Canvases</Link> are analytics processes built using the visual programming environment included in Core. They can be used to build data integrations, visualisations, compute rolling aggregates, or automate interactions with external systems such as Ethereum smart contracts. While any analytics platform can subscribe to streams via the API, canvases are a handy Swiss army knife that offers a tightly-integrated, simple way explore and experiment with data.

- <Link to={links.newdocs.dashboards}>Dashboards</Link> are collections of realtime visualisations, cherry-picked from your canvases. They can be used to build and share a clean, combined realtime view to whatever processes you are applying canvases to. You could, for example, use a set of canvases to calculate metrics from your customer's data, and then create a dashboard to share to the customer a view of the metrics.

- <Link to={links.newdocs.products}>Products</Link> are items which can be published onto the <Link to={links.newdocs.marketplace}>Marketplace</Link> and purchased by other Streamr users. Products contain one or more streams, which the buyer will gain access to after purchasing. Products can be free or have a price tag per a period of time, for example 1 USD per day, paid in <Link to={links.newdocs.dataToken}>DATA</Link>.

## Getting Started

To start using Streamr, check out the <Link to={links.newdocs.gettingStarted}>Getting Started</Link> section as well as <Link to={links.newdocs.tutorials}>Tutorials.</Link>

## Architecture

- Nodes
- Relationship with Ethereum
- Relationship with Core and Marketplace

## Work in Progress

While Streamr already works today, it is still evolving. The roadmap includes working towards full decentralization, node incentives, and new features. Learn more about the project on the <Link to={links.streamrSite}>website</Link>.
